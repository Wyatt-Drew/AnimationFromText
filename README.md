# AnimationFromText
Animation from text is a unique Unity-based animation system designed as an alternative animation process. It leverages a novel method of animating by taking a series of object names, their coordinates, times, and rotations, and loading them to create seamless animations. This approach allows for more dynamic and flexible animation sequences.

## Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible [here](https://wyatt-drew.github.io/AnimationFromText/index.html).
